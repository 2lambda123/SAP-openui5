		<h1>Manual Integration Test: ODataListBinding#create in Sales Orders Application (V2)</h1>
		<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
		Test ODataListBinding#create in the OData V2 Model with the Sales Orders application.
		<h2>PREPARATION</h2>
		To check console errors open the developer tools before starting the application and check
		for each step that there are no errors and warnings.

		<h3>Testing with back end</h3>
		Configure your IDE to be able to execute the Sales Orders application against an ABAP
		back-end system.<br />
		Depending on your installation, you might have to replace Port 8080 in all following links
		with the port of your local server hosting the Sales Orders application.<br />
		It might be necessary to add a URL segment <code>/testsuite</code> directly after the port
		to the following URLs depending on your development setup.<br /><br />
		Start the Sales Orders V2 application with the English locale:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://localhost:8080/test-resources/sap/ui/core/internal/samples/odata/v2/SalesOrders/index.html?sap-language=en&realOData=true">
			http://localhost:8080/test-resources/sap/ui/core/internal/samples/odata/v2/SalesOrders/index.html?sap-language=en&amp;realOData=true
			</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Testing with mock data</h3>
		Configure your IDE to be able to execute the Sales Orders application locally or use a
		centrally deployed version of the Sales Orders application as provided by the test
		coordinator.<br />
		Depending on your installation, you might have to replace Port 8080 in all following links
		with the port of your local server hosting the Sales Orders application.<br />
		It might be necessary to add a URL segment <code>/testsuite</code> directly after the port
		to the following URLs depending on your development setup.<br /><br />
